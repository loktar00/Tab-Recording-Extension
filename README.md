# Tab Recorder Extension

A Chrome extension that allows you to record your current tab, screen, or specific window.

Came about from always running a random html file I made years ago on my desktop to record videos for pull requests. This works exactly the same way using pretty simple built in methods but just offloads it to an extension so it's always available.
